### Project Description: COVID-19 Gene Expression Analysis

**Data Collection and Access:**
- Accessed the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to retrieve raw expression data (microarray or RNA-seq) for datasets GSE166424 and GSE178824.

**Differential Expression Analysis:**
- Utilized GEO2R to perform differential expression analysis for each dataset.
- Focused on identifying overexpressed genes in comparisons:
  - "Severe" vs "Asymptomatic"
  - "Severe" vs "Mild"
  - "Severe" vs "Moderate"

**Gene Enrichment Analysis:**
- Conducted gene enrichment analysis using DAVID to unveil biological pathways or functions associated with the identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs).

**Potential Biomarkers Identification:**
- Analyzed overexpressed genes from the differential expression analysis across different experimental groups.
- Evaluated the biological significance of these genes as potential biomarkers for COVID-19 severity based on gene expression patterns and enrichment analysis results.
